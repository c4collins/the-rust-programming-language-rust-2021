# The Rust Programming Language (for Rust 2021)

I'm working through The Rust Programming Language (for Rust 2021) and this is my code.

I've gone through the book before, a long while ago, and haven't don't enough Rust since, so I'm starting over having learned a lot about other programming things in the interim.


### Timeline: 

- 8 June 2023 - Initial Commit
- 8 June 2023 - Chapter 1 Complete
- 11 June 2023 - Chapter 2 Complete

## Usage

`./run.sh chapter-2/guessing_game/ guessing_game`

- `build.sh` will do a development build & then run the project
    - `rustc.sh` is the same thing but without cargo
- `run.sh` will only build if necessary
- `build-release.sh` will do a release build
- `check.sh` will do a check without a build step
