//! The Rust Book
//!
//! `rust_book` is my collection of the code examples from the book The Rust Programming Language
//! Many are adapted to suit m learning needs or various explorations not covered in the book
//! And, of course, the structure of the project itself isn't described anywhere (and is probably not great haha)

/// There is one module for each chapter in the book (up to where I stopped doing things)
/// but not every chapter is entirely incldued in that module.
/// The easiest example I can give of that is that all of the `tests/` directory, as of Chapter 14 when I'm writing this, is from Chapter 11.
/// but there are other examples.
/// Honestly I'm not sure why you'd reference this as a library for anything, so maybe I won't worry about it beyond that.
